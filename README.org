#+title: Emacs configuration

* Intro
This is a configuration file that includes all of my personal changes and improvements on the GNU Emacs version 30

Everything that I wrote here is ment to be in the =.emacs= or =init.el= file.
Enjoy and feel free to add on new content.

* Installation

To use my configuration clone the repository and put the =init.el= in your =~/.emacs.d/= folder.

The best way to do that is to create a symbolic link to =~/.emacs.d=

#+begin_src bash
  ln -s ~/path/to/cloned/emacs.d/init.el ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src
