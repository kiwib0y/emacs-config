* Intro
This is a configuration file that includes all of my personal changes and improvements on the GNU Emacs version 28.1
(I personally use the GNU Guix package-manager for Emacs, but it should work with versions from other package managers)

Everything that I wrote here is ment to be in the =.emacs= or =init.el= file.
Enjoy and feel free to add on new content.

* Installation
