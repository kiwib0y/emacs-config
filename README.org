* Intro
This is a configuration file that includes all of my personal changes and improvements on the GNU Emacs version 30

Everything that I wrote here is ment to be in the =.emacs= or =init.el= file.
Enjoy and feel free to add on new content.

** Emacs installation

1. Download from the OG repo: git clone [[git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git]].
2. Run the =./autogen.sh= script.
3. Run the =./configure= script with flags =--with-native-compilation=, =--with-json= and =--with-x=.
4. Run the =make install= to install it. You could add the =-j[N]= flag if you want to use more cores.


* Link my =init.el=

To use my configuration clone the repository and put the =init.el= in your =~/.emacs.d/= folder.

The best way to do that is to create a symbolic link to =~/.emacs.d=

#+begin_src bash
  ln -s ~/path/to/cloned/emacs-config/init.el ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src
